## :cd: Installation

### From a release

1. **Get a release of the project**. There are various way to achieve this.

    - Get it from a [releases tarball](https://github.com/gusmin/gate/releases)
    - Package it directly from the repository:

        ```Shell
        $ go get -u github.com/magefile/mage
        $ mage release:linux
        ```

2. **Set up the configuration.**
  
    `cp` the `config.json.template` as `config.json` and edit it according to your needs.

    |           Setting          |                      Description                     |  Value |
    |:--------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|:------:|
    |         **backend_uri**        |          URI of your running backend server          | string |
    |          **ssh_user**          |                 SSH user used for al                 | string |

3. **Install the Gate**

    Go to the previously created release directory and **run the installation script**.

    ```Shell
    $ cd release/securegate-gate-{version}
    $ ./install
    ```

    This installation script will do **EVERYTHING** for you and set up the **Gate** :rainbow:

    - It creates a new user: `secure`
    - Installs the binary `securegate-gate` in `/usr/bin/`
    - Installs your custom configuration
    - Makes a special directory to store your logs in `/var/log/securegate/gate/`
    - Installs the available translations in case you need to change the langage later on.

        *Available languages are English, French and Korean*
    - Set the default shell of the user `secure` to `/usr/bin/securegate-gate`
